# Photography Portfolio 

## About
A rebuild of my existing photography portfolio, utilising ReactJS and SCSS. Framer motion is used to provide a small, delayed sliding animation for the list items within a responsive hamburger menu. 

The hamburger menu is a custom SVG built in Affinity Designer and animated using pure CSS (via transitions, stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset parameters). The nuts & bolts of this hamburger menu are based on Mikael Ainalem's article ["The üçî menu"](https://uxdesign.cc/the-menu-210bec7ad80c).

## The Fine Print
This site is built in ReactJS version 18, and uses Sass version 1.51 for styling and CSS preprocessing. For a full list of dependencies, see the package.json file. 

This project uses the FOSS typeface _Apfel Grotezk Regular_, designed by [Luigi Gorlero](https://www.luigigorlero.com/) and released by [Colletttivo](http://collletttivo.it/).
