# Photography Portfolio 

## About
A rebuild of my existing photography portfolio, utilising ReactJS and SCSS. Framer motion is used to provide a small, delayed sliding animation for the list items within a responsive hamburger menu. 

The hamburger menu is a custom SVG built in Affinity Designer and animated using pure CSS (via transitions, stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset parameters). The nuts & bolts of this hamburger menu are based on Mikael Ainalem's article ["The üçî menu"](https://uxdesign.cc/the-menu-210bec7ad80c). 

## Demo 
### Responsive, Mobile-First Design
As I usually do, I began with a mobile-first design. The previous iteration of my site, built only a few months after I had begun to learn front-end development, was a difficult-to-navigate experience on mobile devices. The new version of the site is much more user and browser-friendly experience:

### Desktop-Friendly, Too!
Of course, photography is a visual medium, and as such I made sure to take full advantage of the increased real estate on desktop screens:

## The Fine Print
This site is built in ReactJS version 18, and uses Sass version 1.51 for styling and CSS preprocessing. For a full list of dependencies, see the package.json file. 

This project uses the FOSS typeface _Apfel Grotezk Regular_, designed by [Luigi Gorlero](https://www.luigigorlero.com/) and released by [Colletttivo](http://collletttivo.it/).
